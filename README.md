## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome/Chromium**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Full support
- **Safari**: Full support
- **Edge**: Full support

## Troubleshooting

### Player not loading

- Ensure you're serving the files over HTTP/HTTPS (not file://)
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify all cast files are present

### Fonts not displaying correctly

- Ensure the `nerdfonts-minimal/` directory contains the font files
- Check browser font loading in developer tools

### Playback issues

- Try refreshing the page
- Check if the cast file is corrupted
- Use browser developer tools to check network requests

## Development

The player is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Key dependencies:

- **asciinema-player**: v3.0.1 (loaded from CDN)
- **JetBrains Mono**: v4.5.0 (loaded from CDN)
- **Nerd Fonts**: Local files for icon support

### Customization

You can modify the appearance by editing the CSS in `player.html`:

- **Colors**: Update the CSS custom properties
- **Layout**: Modify the grid and flexbox layouts
- **Themes**: Add new terminal themes in the theme selector
- **Fonts**: Replace font files in the `nerdfonts-minimal/` directory

## About AML-Omics Pipeline

This cast player demonstrates a comprehensive AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) multi-omics analysis pipeline that:

1. Downloads TCGA-LAML data
2. Performs quality control and preprocessing
3. Integrates multiple omics data types (RNA-seq, methylation, mutations)
4. Identifies patient subtypes using unsupervised clustering
5. Validates findings with clinical data
6. Performs pathway enrichment analysis
7. Predicts drug sensitivity

The pipeline uses advanced bioinformatics tools including MOFA2 for multi-omics integration, consensus clustering for robust subtype identification, and comprehensive survival analysis for clinical validation.
